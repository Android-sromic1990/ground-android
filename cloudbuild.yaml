steps:

#
# Extract the cache
#
# The gradle build cache is stored as a tarball in Google Cloud Storage to
# make builds faster.
#
# After extracting the cache to the /build_cache directory, we need to supply
# that to gradle, and include the volume in steps that require the cache.
#

  id: copy_build_cache
  # we use rsync and not cp so that the step does not fail the first time it is run
  args: ['rsync', 'gs://gradle_cache_$PROJECT_ID/', '/build_cache']
  volumes:
  - name: 'build_cache'
    path: '/build_cache'
